## Description

The goal of this kata is to generate a string version of Pascal's Triangle up to a given line. It's a nice problem to practice a mix of top-down and bottom-up styles.

## Getting Started

- [Java](java/GETTING_STARTED.md)
- [C++](cpp/GETTING_STARTED.md)
- [Go](go/GETTING_STARTED.md)
- [Python](python/GETTING_STARTED.md)

## Useful Links

### For this Kata

- [Wikipedia page on Pascal's Triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_triangle)

### General

- [TCR (Test && Commit || Revert) wrapper](tcr/TCR.md) utility
- Collaborative timer for pairing or mobbing:

  or [agility timer](https://agility.jahed.dev/)

## Session Information

### Style & Duration

Any of the following formats will do:

- 2-hour [Prepared Kata](doc/PreparedKata.md)
- 2-hour [Randori in Pairs](doc/RandoriInPairs.md)
- 2-hour [Randori Kata](doc/RandoriKata.md)
- 2-hour [Mob Kata](doc/MobProgramming.md)

### Topic

Mixing top-down and bottom-up styles. This means starting with top-down, until we discover a brick that would be useful and that we decide to build bottom-up. When the brick is advanced enough, we can plug it back in the main code and do top-down again. We can then alternate a few times between both styles.

### Focus Points

- Early integration of the code
- Understanding of the difference between top-down and bottom-up
- Understanding of how to make the best of both styles

### Source Files

- [Java](java)
